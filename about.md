# About

## Background

I have a PhD in number theory from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver. After graduation I held postdoctoral positions at the [University of Illinois](https://math.illinois.edu/), [Max Planck](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/), and [Université de Montréal](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/). My Erdős number is 3.

While I was working as a mathematician in the Pavillon André-Aisenstadt ([this building](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Deep_Learning/omivDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)), I learned about the spectacular advances in machine learning taking place downstairs. I switched fields, and spent nine months at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) before moving into the private sector. Since then I have worked as a computer vision researcher at [Clemex Technologies](https://www.clemex.com/), and as a data scientist at [Via Science](https://www.solvewithvia.com/).

## Resume

A full resume is available on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogersmontreal/) page.

## Publications

Most of my publications (so far) are in number theory. A full list can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=cnec4HkAAAAJ&hl=fr) or [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9163-4890). Many of my papers are also available as preprints on the [Arxives](https://arxiv.org/a/rogers_m_1.html).
