# About

## Resume

A full resume is available on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogersmontreal/) page.

## Background

I have a PhD in number theory from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.math.ubc.ca/). After graduating, I held postdoctoral positions at the [University of Illinois](https://math.illinois.edu/), [Max Planck](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/), and [Université de Montréal](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/). My Erdős number is 3.

I became interested in machine learning in 2012, while working as a mathematician in the Pavillon André-Aisenstadt ([this building](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Deep_Learning/omivDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)). Eventually I switched fields, spending nine months at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) before moving into the private sector. I have since worked as a computer vision researcher at [Clemex Technologies](https://www.clemex.com/), and as a data scientist at [Via Science](https://www.solvewithvia.com/).

## Publications

So far most of my publications are in number theory. A full list can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=cnec4HkAAAAJ&hl=fr) or [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9163-4890). Many of my papers are also available on the [Arxives](https://arxiv.org/a/rogers_m_1.html).
