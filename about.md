# About

## Resume

My resume is available on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogersmontreal/).

## Background

I have a PhD in number theory from [UBC](https://www.math.ubc.ca/). After graduation, I held postdoctoral positions at [UIUC](https://math.illinois.edu/), [Max Planck](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/), and [Université de Montréal](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/). I also taught courses at [McGill](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/matrogersmtl). My Erdős number is 3.

I became interested in machine learning in 2012, while working as a mathematician in the Pavillon André-Aisenstadt ([this building](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Deep_Learning/omivDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)). I eventually spent nine months at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/), and then moved into the private sector. I have since worked in computer vision at [Clemex Technologies](https://www.clemex.com/), and data science at [Via Science](https://www.solvewithvia.com/).

## Publications

My papers are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=cnec4HkAAAAJ&hl=fr) or [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9163-4890). Preprints are also available on the [Arxives](https://arxiv.org/a/rogers_m_1.html).
