About
=====

I have a PhD in number theory from [UBC](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver. I have held postdoctoral positions at [UIUC](https://math.illinois.edu/), [Max Planck](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/), and the [University of Montreal](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/). I have always been an experimentalist, and I became interested in artificial intelligence while I was working as a mathematician in the Pavillon Andr√©-Aisenstadt (which appears on the cover of the [deep-learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)):


I spent nine months in the LISA lab (now [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/)), before moving into the private sector. I have worked in computer vision at [Clemex Technologies](https://www.clemex.com/), and most recently as a data scientist at [Via Science](https://www.solvewithvia.com/).
