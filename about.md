About Me
========

I have a PhD in number theory from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver. After graduation I held postdoctoral positions at [UIUC](https://math.illinois.edu/), [Max Planck](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/), and the [University of Montreal](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/). My work has always been experimental, so I naturally became interested in AI while working as a mathematician in the Pavillon Andr√©-Aisenstadt (the building on the cover of the [deep-learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)):


I spent nine months at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) before moving into the private sector. I have worked as a computer vision researcher at [Clemex Technologies](https://www.clemex.com/), and I am currently employed as a data scientist at [Via Science](https://www.solvewithvia.com/). In my spare time I enjoy cycling and experimenting with neural artwork for [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matrogersmtl).
